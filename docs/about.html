My initial focus was money, and it's involvement in technology and people; the title is coined from the popular "oh my zsh" terminal customization tool with a twist to reflect how technology—particularly computing—has evolved from a geeky profession into the lucrative field that it is known as. Here are some brief summaries of the projects:</div><br><h2><a href="/I/home.html">Project 1</a></h2><div>In this preliminary project, I discuss the speculative dynamics between humans and artificial intelligence. In particular, I explore how we might perceive such artificially intelligent systems and some scientific/expert commentary on such technologies.  </div><br><h2><a href="/II/home.html">Project 2</a></h2><div>In this project, I explore various topics in preperation for project 3.</div><br><h2><a href="/III/home.html">Project 3</a></h2><div>In this final project, I dive deep into the pipeline of talent that feeds into Silicon Valley. I explore what gaps in participation that  currently exist in the industry, and how these gaps might be deep rooted in the pipeline. In other words, I ask: How early does the pipeline begin? Why does it matter for STEM talent development to begin early? Who is privileged in entering the pipeline at these early stages?</div><br><a href="/index.html">[back]</a></div></div></body></html>
