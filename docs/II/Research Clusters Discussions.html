What seems to be a parody of old talk shows and family sitcoms, Too Many Cooks seems to mock the over positivity and the genericness of such shows. It starts out normal, but then slowly shows the negative, unsettling aspects of life which would otherwise be redacted in normal television, for example, including a creepy pervert, revealing what seems to be a creepy murderous set director, slowly appearing in the backgrounds of each scene (who ends up killing everyone as they're name appears on the scene). Adult swim also adds its signature styles such as a laser shooting cat, violence and gore, and people morphing into animals. Such absurdity likely would never reach mainstream television as the entertainment industry at the time would've likely deemed such content disturbing.</p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8'>Link to "Too Many Cooks" Video</a><p>Moreover, it only plays the intro for the entire duration of the video, showing around 5 seconds of actual plot and then fast forwarding through the credits. It seems to serve as satire against overly positive, bland television, and how often such entertainment is unrealistic and meaningless it might be.</p><h2>Forum 5</h2><p>Prompt: How has the internet shaped the cultural landscape of the world?</p><p>The internet serves as a vastly accessible medium of expression; generally, it seems to allow for more independent publication of articles, tweets, posts, humor, and forms of information. In an internet documentary, Andrew Callaghan explores how such means of publishing media has influenced Chicago violence. To give context, Callaghan previously ran the Youtube channel “All Gas No Breaks,” which covered a variety of absurd topics such as the Flat Earth Conference, Raid of Area 51, Florida Man (both 1 and 2), FurFest, and more. Many featured interviews generally were unfiltered and chaotic, and such topics would typically be redacted in conventional news networks.</p><p>In Callaghan’s O Block Internet Documentary, he explores whether internet influencers such as DJ Akademiks and Adam22 might instigate violence by covering the stories behind Chicago Gang Violence. At some point in the video, DJ Akademiks mentions, “the more people die [or] when someone gets locked up, their streams go up through the roof,” and some of the O Block rappers described feeling like “characters” in some violent plot.</p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPnQbKgotOw' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In an <a href='https://www.jsr.org/hs/index.php/path/article/view/2011'>study</a> on Gen-Z humor, researchers Partlow and Talarczyk investigated the relationship between the absurdity and comedy ratings of a meme, given by high school students, finding that higher rated comedic value is associated with increased absurdity. While conclusions might not be applicable to the entirety of the internet, it seems that generally, the internet has contributed some amount to extremism, polarization, and absurdity in the world. </p><h2>Forum 6</h2><p>We live in a time where a .jpg file can be sold for $69.3M. Scott Reyburn covers such art being sold digitally as NFTs and its implications in his <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html'>NYTimes article</a>. Supporters argue that NFTs push the boundaries of what can be sold—videos, gifs, audio, contracts, and other digital assets beyond just images. To them, NFTs are also a means to “disrupt the traditional art auction model,” and provide benefits such as the lack of need to store, handle, catalog, photograph, or insure the physical art. While the idea of owning a non-physical piece of art seems promising, it also entails the questions of trust, sustainability, and value of art. After reading through this story, I found myself questioning what psychology entails the trust of validation? After all, couldn’t someone simply screenshot a jpg? Moreover, the block chain consumes large amounts of energy; the Ethereum network (dominantly used for NFT contracts) uses almost the same amount of energy as some small countries (<a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf'>White House Gov</a>). Moreover, it doesn’t seem to respect the craft of art—most NFTs are simply computer generated iterations of the same simple image.</p><p>Such generation of images also poses a threat to the artist community. In another <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/technology/openai-images-dall-e.html'>article</a>, Cade Metz discusses the cutting-edge image generation tool, DALL-E by OpenAI. It uses neural networks to both parse language and output a realistic photo based on the given description. Trained and used in the real world, it presents dangers such as deepfakes, misinformation, and bias. As safety precautions, OpenAI adds a watermark, filters out what it deems inappropriate, and states that DALL-E is meant to explore the capabilities of tech rather than to serve as a product.</p><p>All of this begs the question, what will the future of art look like? Will we see NFT auction houses of DALL-E generated images? Will museums be filled with TV Screens or VR/AR showcases? Will we even have physical museums, and what would that mean for the art community? It seems that there is a lot of uncertainty in the potential of such technologies to take over the art world.</p><h2>Forum 8</h2><p>Davey Alba discusses how cute cat images can lead to misinformation through unexpected means. She demonstrates how this cat images might be posted on Facebook's packaged with links to websites which post right-wing conspiracies and anti-China content. Alba also explains how these cat images are used to bait people into subscribing to these same websites. This observation parallels some of the content that I used to see on Instagram's suggested page—posts about art, products, and memes which have strings attached such as advertisements. These advertisements could be completely unrelated, misleading, and annoying. However, these posts entice people continue to click on them since they often leave the spam content in places that aren't displayed on the home page. Generally however, many users might express their discontent with such accounts profiting from these &quot;spam&quot; advertisements, however such comments are usually filtered out or diluted with bot accounts. Such methods of using innocent content to pull people into subscribing to publications or sites that spread false information about things like election fraud, unproven coronavirus cures, and other baseless conspiracy theories. While the videos themselves don't contain false information, they can be used to draw people in to a site or publication that does. This is a problem for Facebook and other tech platforms, because the videos don't violate any of their rules. While Facebook has taken action against some of these accounts, the quantity of such accounts and the easy virality of such misinformation is difficult to combat.</p><p>Moreover, going back in time, we see how conspiracy theories existed and how they impacted the past. In their article, Annika Neklason explores how the Civil War was impacted by conspiracy theories that festered in the southern living rooms and legislative chambers. Neklason discusses how these theories deepened sectional divisions and made the question of slavery all but impossible to settle peacefully. The theories helped fuel the deadliest war in the nation’s history. And their violent legacy has lingered across centuries. Similar to how the Facebook posts exploited the popularity of cat videos, it seems that the news and media during the Civil War times exploited the negative emotions and hate to perpetuate these conspiracy theories. People were afraid of what the future held and they used their power to try and control it. While the intentions might have been to unite the South, the result was a war that killed millions.</p></div></div><div class="push"></div><div class="foot"><a href="#top">[back to top ↑]</a>⠀|⠀<a href="/II/home.html">[Proj II Home]</a><div class="push"></div></div></div></body></html>
