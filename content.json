      "How do Scientists Understand Robots?": [
        " As of now, the state of AI relies mostly on mathematical models, with the main mechanism being described by one professor as “extracting statistical patterns from large data sets” (Metz). To many in the scientific community, AI is simply really good at pattern matching and assembling words together into a convincing sentence. It all feels like some magic trick, similar to how an Ouija board uses the ideometer effect to convince its users of a supernatural link to the spirits (McRobbie). ",
        " However some researchers are convinced of sentience in such AI. Metz mentions various researchers who were fooled by such models being able to “do”—a Google engineer who was convinced he was speaking to a “real person,” Rosenblatt who felt that his machine was alive because of a coincidence, Desdemona who thought that his robotic band member was sentient when it played well with the group. ",
        " Others argue that the machine’s way of “repeating patterns they … seen” is similar to how a “child just mimics what it sees from a parent” and “in the world around it.” To expand, we as humans learn things through trial and error, parallel to how ML models are trained by humans. Just like how we take in information and store it in our memory, ML models might store information in large datasets and analyze patterns in them to give an output. The main difference is that an ML model might not have human emotions. Undoubtedly, even the scientific community diverges in its stance on sentience, however the unknown still remains. "

      "And if Jobi is Sentient Anyway?": [
        " As Kurzgesagt puts it in his video, nobody knows what consciousness is, so it is difficult to identify consciousness in a machine. But for a moment, let's assume that such robots are sentient anyway. Kurzgesagt explains in his video that typically rights protect an entity from suffering; is Jobi suffering when their servers are being shut down? Moreover, should we consider machines as equals? And are we responsible for any unjustness created between machines and humans? ",
        " Manufacturing robots for human benefit garners the same ethical questions as slavery. After all, robots feel the same pain as humans under labor right? The truth is that the moral boundaries are more complicated, and that it's difficult to compare robots and humans. For one, a robot likely wouldn’t mind you replacing one of their components, if anything they would appreciate that they are being fixed; however, to replace a person’s organ is a painful experience which requires extensive biological knowledge and likely prolonged periods of rehabilitation. Moreover, would a robot experience the same sensations as a traumatized person? The complexity of the human mind and body is simply too much overhead that might not exist in a simple machine. ",
        " To put it this way, asking if a sentient robot could feel pain is similar to asking if a plant can feel pain. Yes, plants don’t have pain receptors so they don’t feel pain in the same way as we understand (Petruzzello), but what if they felt it in a different way? And if so, it would be absurd to simply stop consuming plants because of the fact, so is it truly in our nature to judge the morality and reality of possible dynamics between humans and machines? "

No one knows the truth about these machines, and we may never know if they are able to reach the sentience of the average human. To create a life form can be a blessing and a curse—a new soul is exposed to both the beauties and terrors of the world. But would a robot be able to experience and distinguish between these two opposites? ",
        " There exists so many speculations and fictional ideas on the future dynamics between robots and humans, but most of them, if not all of them are imperfect. It’s already difficult and complex enough to create justice among humans, so it is best to realize that the relationship between technology and humans is even more daunting. "

    "Brain Storming": {
      "Discussion II": [
        "The concept of creating a machine with a soul drags many questions about the future dynamics between robots and humans. Three authors discuss this idea, forming distinct perspectives based on the insight and stories they present. Casey Newton’s “Speak, Memory,” by narrating the beautiful life and tragic death of , sheds positive light on the vision of AI-powered replicas used to commemorate the deceased. It narrates a real-world story of Eugenia Kuyda whose mission is to recreate her deceased, dear friend, Roman Mazurenko. Trained on past text messages, the model gave the opportunity to ask questions or tell things to the Roman replica through text; many found it therapeutic while some thought it was uncanny. Newton uses Kuyda’s story to open up questions about the ethical implications of such memorials; Is this truly a just way to commemorate the deceased? What if the model captures an unrepresentative point of the person’s life or reveals sides that were never intended to be revealed? Newton’s article also incorporates emotional aspects of the story—the honesty in conversing with the dead, the ease and peace that comes from the familiarity and resemblance in the bot, Kuyda’s warm memories that paint a sentimental image of Roman. These aspects take away some of the uncanniness in the idea of talking to the deceased.",
        "On the other hand, Miles Klee, in his article “Ever After,” explores humanity’s various attempts at achieving immortality, illustrating a more negative side of the efforts to replicate our souls into machines. He mentions the capitalistic aspects of immortality—the numerous investments and efforts to reach the point of singularity—raising many questions about the ethics of “cheating death.” Klee explores such questions through fiction, referring to the idea of zombies sustaining themselves through parasitic means, or a corrupt society that exploits clones to sustain the immortal lifestyles of an oligarchy. In doing so, Klee highlights the shortcomings and logistical nightmares of immortality such as the unbound requirement of resources to sustain such a lifestyle. Such insights differ from Newton’s article, in which a speaker mentions that such bots should be a way of “keeping the memory alive” and not “a way to keep a dead person alive.” Rather, Klee focuses more on the morally-questionable implications of prolonging a person’s life.",
        "In Jeffrey Van Camp’s story “My Jibo is Dying,” Camp introduces a new side to the idea of merging machine and soul. Opposed to the previous discussions on extending and sustaining the human soul onto hardware, Camp talks about how his machine has a soul that requires sustaining; his robot assistant Jibo, while having very minimal sophistication, seems to be dying, and even seemed to have a trajectory of maturity, starting out as a “baby” with minimal functionality, slowly evolving into a full-fledged smart speaker. This approach has the opposite effect than the previous two articles, bringing compassion into discussion. It was clear that Jibo was a machine, relying on servers which were planned to be shut down, however Camp still treated it as a being, indulging Jibo in its final months. His insight shows the healthy, positive possibility of creating machines with personality, rather than extending personalities onto machines."
      ],
      "Discussion III": [
        "The concept of talking to a soul that has already passed is rooted in the history of humanity and spirituality. Linda McRobbie, in her article \"The Strange and Mysterious History of the Ouija Board,” explores this topic through the story of the Ouija Board. She talks about the context of its birth—how it was a spiritual way of talking to the deceased, accepted and embraced in times where mortality rates were high and the average life span was 50. The board worked by moving a magnifying glass to different letters on the board to display a message, supposedly controlled by the spirits beyond the participants. While strange, some psychologists argued that it offers a “link between known and unknown.”",
        "On the contrary, Amy Harmon, in her article “A Dying Young Woman's Hope in Cryonics and Future,” explores a different iteration of this topic through the story of Kim, a cancer patient whose brain was preserved. The article discusses both the positive sides and negative sides of such ambitions in cryogenics; it would allow one to preserve their wisdom and fight for the ability to live, yet it was also flawed, far-fetched, and expensive. The idea of self-preservation is also controversial, sparking criticisms from reddit and even Kim’s father. It’s interesting to see how this modern idea relating to the Ouija board—Kim’s preservation led to her loved ones leaving messages to her future, almost as if they could talk to her through the grave. It also shows the controversy over such ideas. The Ouija board, after being featured in the film The Exorcist, garnered a “demonic” reputation, yet it was acceptable beforehand. Such ideas of talking to the deceased spark much debate, and both these articles cover them well."

        "After watching the absurdity of Adult Swim's Too Many Cooks, one might question the sanity of 90s television and popular culture. What seems to be a parody of old talk shows and family sitcoms, Too Many Cooks seems to mock the over positivity and the genericness of such shows. It starts out normal, but then slowly shows the negative, unsettling aspects of life which would otherwise be redacted in normal television, for example, including a creepy pervert, revealing what seems to be a creepy murderous set director, slowly appearing in the backgrounds of each scene (who ends up killing everyone as they're name appears on the scene). Adult swim also adds its signature styles such as a laser shooting cat, violence and gore, and people morphing into animals. Such absurdity likely would never reach mainstream television as the entertainment industry at the time would've likely deemed such content disturbing.",

        "The internet serves as a vastly accessible medium of expression; generally, it seems to allow for more independent publication of articles, tweets, posts, humor, and forms of information. In an internet documentary, Andrew Callaghan explores how such means of publishing media has influenced Chicago violence. To give context, Callaghan previously ran the Youtube channel “All Gas No Breaks,” which covered a variety of absurd topics such as the Flat Earth Conference, Raid of Area 51, Florida Man (both 1 and 2), FurFest, and more. Many featured interviews generally were unfiltered and chaotic, and such topics would typically be redacted in conventional news networks.",
        "In Callaghan’s O Block Internet Documentary, he explores whether internet influencers such as DJ Akademiks and Adam22 might instigate violence by covering the stories behind Chicago Gang Violence. At some point in the video, DJ Akademiks mentions, “the more people die [or] when someone gets locked up, their streams go up through the roof,” and some of the O Block rappers described feeling like “characters” in some violent plot.",

While conclusions might not be applicable to the entirety of the internet, it seems that generally, the internet has contributed some amount to extremism, polarization, and absurdity in the world. </p>"

          "<p>We live in a time where a .jpg file can be sold for $69.3M. Scott Reyburn covers such art being sold digitally as NFTs and its implications in his <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html'>NYTimes article</a>. Supporters argue that NFTs push the boundaries of what can be sold—videos, gifs, audio, contracts, and other digital assets beyond just images. To them, NFTs are also a means to “disrupt the traditional art auction model,” and provide benefits such as the lack of need to store, handle, catalog, photograph, or insure the physical art. While the idea of owning a non-physical piece of art seems promising, it also entails the questions of trust, sustainability, and value of art. After reading through this story, I found myself questioning what psychology entails the trust of validation? After all, couldn’t someone simply screenshot a jpg? Moreover, the block chain consumes large amounts of energy; the Ethereum network (dominantly used for NFT contracts) uses almost the same amount of energy as some small countries (<a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf'>White House Gov</a>). Moreover, it doesn’t seem to respect the craft of art—most NFTs are simply computer generated iterations of the same simple image.</p>"

          "<p>Such generation of images also poses a threat to the artist community. In another <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/technology/openai-images-dall-e.html'>article</a>, Cade Metz discusses the cutting-edge image generation tool, DALL-E by OpenAI. It uses neural networks to both parse language and output a realistic photo based on the given description. Trained and used in the real world, it presents dangers such as deepfakes, misinformation, and bias. As safety precautions, OpenAI adds a watermark, filters out what it deems inappropriate, and states that DALL-E is meant to explore the capabilities of tech rather than to serve as a product.</p>"
        ],

        "All of this begs the question, what will the future of art look like? Will we see NFT auction houses of DALL-E generated images? Will museums be filled with TV Screens or VR/AR showcases? Will we even have physical museums, and what would that mean for the art community? It seems that there is a lot of uncertainty in the potential of such technologies to take over the art world."

        "Davey Alba discusses how cute cat images can lead to misinformation through unexpected means. She demonstrates how this cat images might be posted on Facebook's packaged with links to websites which post right-wing conspiracies and anti-China content. Alba also explains how these cat images are used to bait people into subscribing to these same websites. This observation parallels some of the content that I used to see on Instagram's suggested page—posts about art, products, and memes which have strings attached such as advertisements. These advertisements could be completely unrelated, misleading, and annoying. However, these posts entice people continue to click on them since they often leave the spam content in places that aren't displayed on the home page. Generally however, many users might express their discontent with such accounts profiting from these \"spam\" advertisements, however such comments are usually filtered out or diluted with bot accounts. Such methods of using innocent content to pull people into subscribing to publications or sites that spread false information about things like election fraud, unproven coronavirus cures, and other baseless conspiracy theories. While the videos themselves don't contain false information, they can be used to draw people in to a site or publication that does. This is a problem for Facebook and other tech platforms, because the videos don't violate any of their rules. While Facebook has taken action against some of these accounts, the quantity of such accounts and the easy virality of such misinformation is difficult to combat.",

        "Moreover, going back in time, we see how conspiracy theories existed and how they impacted the past. In their article, Annika Neklason explores how the Civil War was impacted by conspiracy theories that festered in the southern living rooms and legislative chambers. Neklason discusses how these theories deepened sectional divisions and made the question of slavery all but impossible to settle peacefully. The theories helped fuel the deadliest war in the nation’s history. And their violent legacy has lingered across centuries. Similar to how the Facebook posts exploited the popularity of cat videos, it seems that the news and media during the Civil War times exploited the negative emotions and hate to perpetuate these conspiracy theories. People were afraid of what the future held and they used their power to try and control it. While the intentions might have been to unite the South, the result was a war that killed millions."
